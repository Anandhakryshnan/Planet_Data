# Project: Solar System Planets Data Table

## Overview
This project aims to create an HTML data table for easy reference of facts and figures about the planets in our solar system. The table will be structured to facilitate learning for students studying planetary science.

## Instructions
1. Open the provided HTML template (`blank-template.html`) to initiate the table structure.
2. Add an outer container, table header, and table body to the HTML file.
3. Incorporate the provided caption to describe the table's content.
4. Populate the table header with column headers.
5. Fill the table body with content rows, ensuring semantic headings for each row.
6. Place the data from the raw dataset into the appropriate cells, associating each row of planet data with its corresponding planet.
7. Utilize attributes to clearly associate row and column headers with their respective rows, columns, or rowgroups.
8. Apply a black border specifically around the column containing planet name row headers to enhance readability.

## Tips
- The first cell of the header row should be left blank and span two columns.
- Ensure that group row headings (e.g., "Jovian planets") correctly span the required number of rows and columns.
- There's a more straightforward method of associating headers with rows/columns that can be employed.

## Deliverables
Upon completion, the project should yield a well-structured HTML data table containing essential information about the planets of our solar system, optimized for educational purposes.
